# Jacquard Cloud APIs

* The firmware updating portions of the Jacquard SDK rely on access to
  Jacquard Cloud APIs to list and fetch firmware updates for Jacquard
  tags.
* To enable this access, the SDK requires an API Key.
* Use of the Jacquard Cloud API requires agreeing to the below Terms
  of Service.
* The Jacquard Cloud API is designed to be used only via the
  Jacquard SDK and your app code should not access it directly.
* Once you have read and agreed to the Terms of Service, click the
  checkbox below to obtain a temporary API key suitable for testing,
  exploration and/or other such preliminary uses.

<li> The Jacquard Cloud API is designed to, and may only, be used with
     the Jacquard SDK and your app code may not access it directly;
<li> The Jacquard Cloud API is currently a developer preview version
     and can be used for testing, exploration and/or other such preliminary
     uses; and
