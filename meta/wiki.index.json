In common with any SDK dealing with hardware, using the Jacquqard SDK requires dealing with a lot of asynchronous events. The Jacquard team\u2019s experience with this and other products has informed the design of this SDK to help you with this complexity. If you follow the patterns in our sample code you will avoid many common pitfalls and edge cases.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"making-invalid-state-unrepresentable\"><a href=\"#making-invalid-state-unrepresentable\" id=\"making-invalid-state-unrepresentable\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>Making invalid state unrepresentable<\/h3>\n<p>The principle coined and popularized by Yaron Minsky of making illegal states unrepresentable is very relevant to a hardware SDK. The goal is that the SDK should be difficult to use incorrectly. Achieving this goal takes careful API design, and we welcome any feedback about cases where you find we have missed the mark.<\/p>\n<p>There are two main tools we use to achieve this. The first is using the Swift type system to reflect instance capabilities and requirements. The second is using Combine to provide a pattern where attempting to use a stale or disconnected Tag instance is precluded (more on this in the next section).<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"connecting-to-tags\"><a href=\"#connecting-to-tags\" id=\"connecting-to-tags\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>Connecting to Tags<\/h2>\n<p>A JacquardManager instance allows you to find advertising Jacquard tags and connect to them, yielding a ConnectedTag instance (and an updated one any time the connection is lost and reconnected). This ConnectedTag instance is what you will use to access the tag and gear functionality.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"../../assets/media/apis/connect.png\" alt=\"Block diagram showing JacquardManager.connect\" /><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"connectedtag\"><a href=\"#connectedtag\" id=\"connectedtag\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>ConnectedTag<\/h2>\n<p>Once you have obtained a ConnectedTag instance from the connect publisher you can use it to send Commands and subscribe to Notifications. Some commands work with just a connection to the Tag, others require Jacquard garment or gear attached - the attachment state can also be observed via the ConnectedTag.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"../../assets/media/apis/connected.png\" alt=\"Block diagram showing ConnectedTag\" /><\/p>\n"

Many issues can be resolved quickly and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.<\/p>\n<p>Reports should be directed to [PROJECT STEWARD NAME(s) AND EMAIL(s)], the Project Steward(s) for [PROJECT NAME]. It is the Project Steward\u2019s duty to receive and address reported violations of the code of conduct.

We will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent expulsion from the project and project-sponsored spaces.

Integrate Jacquard SDK<\/h2>\n<p>It's easy to integrate the Jacquard SDK using Maven. First, you need to include GMaven into your project gradle file - <code>build.gradle (Project: Jacquard_Tutorial)<\/code>.<\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">allprojects {\n  repositories {\n    ...\n    maven {\n        url &quot;https://maven.google.com/&quot;\n    }\n  }\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Then you need to include Jacquard in the <code>dependencies<\/code> section of your application's gradle file - <code>build.gradle (Module: Jacquard_Tutorial.app)<\/code>.\nYou might need to expand the Gradle Scripts dropdown in the Project panel on the left.<\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">implementation &quot;com.google.jacquard:jacquard-sdk:0.2.0&quot;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<h2 id=\"4-add-the-scanning-recyclerview\"><a href=\"#4-add-the-scanning-recyclerview\" id=\"4-add-the-scanning-recyclerview\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a><a name=\"section4\"><\/a>4. Add the scanning RecyclerView<\/h2>\n<p>The app you will make has two screens. The first is a RecyclerView\nlisting any nearby advertising tags. The second is a screen with a few\nsimple labels and buttons which you will connect to Jacquard\nfunctions.<\/p>\n<p>First lets set up the Scanning activity.<\/p>\n<ol class=\"tutorial_list\">\n<li>Select <code>File &gt; New &gt; Activity &gt; Empty Activity<\/code>.\n<img src=\"../../assets/media/tutorial/create_main_activity.png\" alt=\"Create main activity\" />\nWe will also make this the main activity.<\/li>\n<li>Open <code>activity_main.xml<\/code> and add a RecyclerView. Your activity layout file should look something like this if you select &quot;Split&quot; view:\n<img src=\"../../assets/media/tutorial/activity_main.png\" alt=\"Main activity layout\" /><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Now we can start coding!<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"set-blue-tooth-permissions\"><a href=\"#set-blue-tooth-permissions\" id=\"set-blue-tooth-permissions\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>Set blue tooth permissions<\/h3>\n<p>First we need to request for bluetooth permissions, which also requires fine location permission. In <code>AndroidManifest.xml<\/code>, make sure you have these\npermissions:<\/p>\n<pre><code>&lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.BLUETOOTH&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION&quot; /&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<h3 id=\"create-recyclerview-adapter\"><a href=\"#create-recyclerview-adapter\" id=\"create-recyclerview-adapter\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>Create RecyclerView adapter<\/h3>\n<p>We have to create an adapter to update the RecycleView's UI. Create a file named <code>TagListAdapter<\/code>. In this adapter, we are going to implement a simple\nitem UI with just the name of the tag:<\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">public class TagListAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter&lt;TagListAdapter.AdvertisedJacquardTagViewHolder&gt; {\n  private List&lt;AdvertisedJacquardTag&gt; tagList;\n\n  public TagListAdapter(List&lt;AdvertisedJacquardTag&gt; tagList) {\n    this.tagList = tagList;\n  }\n\n  @NonNull\n  @Override\n  public AdvertisedJacquardTagViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(@NonNull ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {\n    LayoutInflater layoutInflater = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext());\n    View view = layoutInflater.inflate(R.layout.tag_item, parent, false);\n    return new AdvertisedJacquardTagViewHolder(view);\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public int getItemCount() {\n    return tagList.size();\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public void onBindViewHolder(@NonNull AdvertisedJacquardTagViewHolder holder, int position) {\n    holder.bindView(tagList.get(position).displayName());\n  }\n\n  class AdvertisedJacquardTagViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder implements View.OnClickListener {\n\n    private final View view;\n\n    AdvertisedJacquardTagViewHolder(View itemView) {\n      super(itemView);\n      view = itemView;\n      view.setOnClickListener(this);\n    }\n\n    void bindView(String name) {\n      TextView tv = view.findViewById(R.id.tag_item_name);\n      tv.setText(name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onClick(View v) {\n      // Item click\n    }\n  }\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>And the layout file should look something like the following:<\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-xml\">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;RelativeLayout xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;\n    android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\n    android:layout_height=&quot;80dp&quot;&gt;\n\n  &lt;TextView\n      android:id=&quot;@+id/tag_item_name&quot;\n      android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\n      android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;\n      android:gravity=&quot;center_vertical&quot; /&gt;\n\n&lt;/RelativeLayout&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<h3 id=\"setup-recyclerview\"><a href=\"#setup-recyclerview\" id=\"setup-recyclerview\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>Setup RecyclerView<\/h3>\n<p>Now switching back to your MainActivity file.

Updating firmware<\/h2>\n<p>Before using any Jacquard SDK core api, it is always recommended to ensure that you have the latest\navailable firmware. When your tag is paired, next ideal step should be to check for firmware update\nby calling Jacquard firmware apis which are backed up by Jacquard cloud.\nUpdating firmware is a 3 step process -<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"1-check-if-update-available\"><a href=\"#1-check-if-update-available\" id=\"1-check-if-update-available\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>1. Check if update available<\/h4>\n<p>This step would need internet connectivity as it calls Jacquard cloud api to see if any firmware\nupdates are available. If update are available for your current firmware either MANDATORY or\nOPTIONAL, sdk will start downloading firmware binary implicitly. This step will be completed when\nfirmware binary is downloaded successfully. You do not need to worry about downloaded binary, sdk\nwill use it when you try to apply the updates.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"2-apply-updates\"><a href=\"#2-apply-updates\" id=\"2-apply-updates\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>2. Apply updates<\/h4>\n<p>Jacquard sdk will transfer downloaded firmware binary to the tag using bluetooth high priority\nconnection. This step might take a while depending on the size of downloaded firmware binary.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"3-execute-updates\"><a href=\"#3-execute-updates\" id=\"3-execute-updates\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>3. Execute updates<\/h4>\n<p>In this step, Jacquard sdk will install the firmware binary on the tag. If you have send\n<code>autoExecute=true<\/code> in step 2, you can skip this step. For tag and interposer firmware update, this\nis a mandatory step however in case of loadable module, this step is not required.<\/p>\n<p>Let's start with the implementation. It's pretty much straight forward.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4 id=\"update-tag--interposer-firmware\"><a href=\"#update-tag--interposer-firmware\" id=\"update-tag--interposer-firmware\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>Update tag / interposer firmware<\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5 id=\"1-check-if-update-available--\"><a href=\"#1-check-if-update-available--\" id=\"1-check-if-update-available--\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>1. Check if update available -<\/h5>\n<p>To check if update is available for both tag and interposer, insert your tag into your\ngear and use below piece of code -<\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">public Signal&lt;List&lt;DFUInfo&gt;&gt; checkFirmware(boolean forceUpdate) {\n  return connectedJacquardTag.dfuManager().checkFirmware(connectedJacquardTag.getComponents(), forceUpdate);\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This code will return list of <code>DFUInfo<\/code> for each input component. Check the value for\n<code>DFUInfo.dfuStatus()<\/code> to know what type of firmware update is available. It could be either\n<code>MANDATORY<\/code> or <code>OPTIONAL<\/code> or <code>NOT_AVAILABLE<\/code>. You can set <code>forceUpdate<\/code> as <code>true<\/code> to always hit the\ncloud ignoring the local cache. To get firmare updates from local cache, set <code>forceUpdate<\/code> as <code>false<\/code>.<\/p>\n<h5 id=\"2-apply-updates--\"><a href=\"#2-apply-updates--\" id=\"2-apply-updates--\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>2. Apply updates -<\/h5>\n<p>Here, Jacquard sdk will transfer downloaded firmware binary from mobile to the tag. You need to use\nlist of <code>DFUInfo<\/code> which you have received in previous step.<\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">public Signal&lt;FirmwareUpdateState&gt; applyUpdates(List&lt;DFUInfo&gt; dfuInfos, boolean autoExecute){\n  return connectedJacquardTag.dfuManager().applyUpdates(dfuInfos, autoExecute);\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p><code>FirmwareUpdateState<\/code> returned will give you the exact status of the operation. When Jacquard sdk\nstarts transferring firmware binary to the tag i.e. state is <code>TRANSFER_PROGRESS<\/code>, you can track the\ntransfer progress using <code>FirmwareUpdateState#transferProgress<\/code>. You can use <code>autoExecute=true<\/code> to\ninstall the updates automatically otherwise you need to call below <code>executeUpdates()<\/code> api explicitly.\n<code>FirwareUpdateState.error()<\/code> will give you the error occurred in this step.<\/p>\n<h5 id=\"3-execute-updates--\"><a href=\"#3-execute-updates--\" id=\"3-execute-updates--\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>3. Execute updates -<\/h5>\n<p>This is the last step in firmware update in which Jacquard sdk instructs tag to install the firmware\nbinary transferred in previous step. This step is not required if you are sending <code>autoExecute=true<\/code>\nin <code>applyUpdates()<\/code> api. If you are updating tag firmware, tag will reboot during this step.<\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">public Signal&lt;FirmwareUpdateState&gt; executeFirmware(){\n  return connectedJacquardTag.dfuManager().executeUpdates();\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p><code>FirmwareUpdateState<\/code> returned by this api can either be <code>EXECUTING<\/code> or <code>COMPLETED<\/code>.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h4 id=\"update-loadable-module\"><a href=\"#update-loadable-module\" id=\"update-loadable-module\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>Update Loadable Module<\/h4>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5 id=\"1-check-if-update-available---1\"><a href=\"#1-check-if-update-available---1\" id=\"1-check-if-update-available---1\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>1. Check if update available -<\/h5>\n<p>You can execute <code>ListModulesCommand<\/code> command to fetch all loadable modules present on the tag. This\ncommand will give you <code>List&lt;Module&gt;<\/code>. Similar to tag &amp; interposer firmware update, first step here\nis also to check if update is available using below api -<\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">public Signal&lt;DFUInfo&gt; checkModuleUpdate(Module module) {\n  return connectedJacquardTag.dfuManager().checkModuleUpdate(module);\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This code will return <code>DFUInfo<\/code> for <code>Module<\/code> used as input.

Apply module updates -<\/h5>\n<p>This step is pretty much similar to step 2 of tag &amp; interposer updates.

Motion Capture<\/h2>\n<p>With this feature, you can record, view and download your tag's Inertial Measurement Unit\n(IMU) motion sensor data: accelerometer (x, y, z), and gyroscope (yaw, pitch, roll) data. This section\nwill guide you to record, download, parse, erase Imu session.

Initialize process will be quicker when Data Collection Loadable Module\n(DCLM) is present on the tag and its activated. If DCLM is not present on the tag, <code>ImuModule<\/code> will\nperform device firmware update to download DCLM binary from cloud and send it to the tag.

Start &amp; stop Imu session<\/h4>\n<p>You can start collecting Imu samples by calling <code>Signal&lt;String&gt; startImuSession()<\/code> api. This api\nreturns unique Imu session id which is nothing but unix timestamp in seconds. Call <code>Signal&lt;Boolean&gt; stopImuSession()<\/code> to end current Imu session. Important point to remember here is that - you should\nnot attach/detach the tag from gear during Imu session. Which means - while starting a new Imu session\nwhichever is the gear state, either attached or detached, must be same till you call <code>stopImuSession()<\/code>\napi.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"4-fetch-imu-session-list\"><a href=\"#4-fetch-imu-session-list\" id=\"4-fetch-imu-session-list\" class=\"anchor\"><\/a>4.
